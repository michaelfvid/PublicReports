## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This study represents a pioneering effort in remote acoustic monitoring of rod pumps (pumpjacks) using advanced signal processing techniques. The project analyzed >5 hours of acoustic data from two 8-meter pumpjacks in Texas, recorded at 20-meter distance under various temporal conditions (day/night/evening samples).

**Key Finding:** While remote acoustic monitoring at 20m distance has significant limitations due to physics constraints (SNR = 3dB), the methodology successfully demonstrates **operational state detection** and **temporal pattern recognition** capabilities relevant for large-scale field monitoring.
